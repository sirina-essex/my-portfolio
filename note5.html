								<h2>Contribution to Noora Alboinin's Post on the case study</h2>

								<blockquote>
									<p>The contribution accurately highlights fundamental issues related to ethical responsibility in the presentation of statistical results, notably the importance of transparency, integrity, and the duty to raise concerns when public risk is involved. These elements align with the expectations outlined in professional codes of conduct that govern scientific and analytical practice (National Academies of Sciences, 2017).</p>
                                    <p> Two complementary dimensions further deepen this ethical analysis: methodological traceability and the clarification of professional boundaries within the broader chain of responsibility.</p>
                                    <p>First, methodological traceability ensures that all analytical decisions (from variable selection to the application of statistical treatments) are rigorously documented and verifiable by third parties. Gelman and Loken (2014) argue that the absence of clear documentation constitutes a direct threat to scientific integrity, as it undermines both transparency and reproducibility. In Abi’s case, this means that beyond presenting final results, he is ethically required to disclose the methodological steps that led to those results, enabling a comprehensive and honest assessment of his analytical work.</p>
                                    <p>Second, it is essential to delineate roles and responsibilities in collaborative projects involving sensitive or publicly impactful data. Steneck (2006) reminds us that researchers and analysts are accountable for the quality, clarity, and interpretability of their work, but not for the ultimate use of that work by other actors such as communicators, marketers, or regulatory authorities. From this perspective, Abi must act with rigour, raise concerns when misuse is foreseeable, and document his process thoroughly, yet he should not be held responsible for decisions beyond his functional scope.</p>
                                    <p>In this context, professional ethics go beyond statistical accuracy or individual intent. They demand procedural transparency and a clear distribution of responsibility within institutions. Vigilance cannot rest on a single actor; it must be shared and structured through common frameworks. Macrina (2014) further emphasises the need for explicit, institutionalised ethical structures that support coherent coordination among all parties involved.</p>

								<h2>Contribution to Kingsley Onyeemeosi's Post on the case study</h2>
								<p><strong>Peer response by Stephanie Irina - Tuesday, 17 June 2025, 2:53 PM</strong>
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>The contribution highlights key issues related to statistical integrity, transparency, and the ethical responsibility of the professional in light of the health, social, and legal repercussions of their analysis. This interpretation can be reinforced by two complementary dimensions: the use of ethical frameworks to guide action in situations of ethical tension, and the consideration of growing public distrust in science, fueled by practices perceived as strategic or biased.</p>
									<p>Codes of conduct such as those of the ACM (2022) explicitly outline the obligations of data professionals in terms of rigor, honesty, and rejection of any form of manipulation. These codes are not limited to general recommendations; they require professionals to report any misuse, refrain from intentional concealment or omission, and produce accurate, verifiable, and contextualized information. In this context, Abi not only has a duty to document the results but also to ensure that their presentation cannot be misused for misleading purposes.</p>
									<p>It is essential to situate these practices within the broader context of declining public trust in scientific research and experts. As Ritchie (2020) points out, even seemingly minor biases, when repeated or institutionalized, contribute to widespread distrust, which undermines adherence to scientific recommendations, risk regulation, and the legitimacy of institutions. In the case of a mass-market food product, any attempt to downplay risks, even through methodologically acceptable means, may be perceived as a deliberate strategy, reinforcing the notion of a biased system at the expense of the public interest.</p>
									<p>Ethical responsibility therefore goes beyond the internal validity of a line of reasoning. It extends to how expertise is mobilized, communicated, and perceived in the public sphere, according to standards defined not only by science but also by the trust it inspires.</p>
