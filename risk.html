						<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
					</header>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Understanding the definitions and fundamental concepts of risk management</strong>
						</li>
						<p>Identify and apply key definitions of risk according to normative frameworks such as ISO
							31000, ISO 27005, and NIST SP 800-30. Differentiate between qualitative and quantitative
							approaches in risk evaluation.</p>

						<li><strong>Threat modeling and vulnerability management</strong></li>
						<p>Utilize threat modeling techniques such as STRIDE, Attack Trees, and PASTA to identify,
							categorize, and prioritize threats in complex systems. Analyze specific threat scenarios
							using frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK and OWASP to strengthen the security of critical
							infrastructures.</p>

						<li><strong>Utilization of security standards in various industry sectors</strong></li>
						<p>Apply security standards such as GDPR, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS to ensure regulatory compliance
							and the security of information systems across different sectors. Integrate security
							standards into risk management models to minimize risks related to data protection and
							cyberattacks.</p>

						<li><strong>Application of quantitative techniques for risk management</strong></li>
						<p>Apply quantitative risk modeling techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, Bayes’ theorem,
							and multicriteria methods (AHP, ANP) to quantify uncertainties and prioritize risks in
							complex environments. Select and justify the appropriate quantitative techniques based on
							specific risk management scenarios.</p>

						<li><strong>Development and implementation of business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR)
								plans</strong></li>
						<p>Design business continuity and disaster recovery plans based on Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
							and Recovery Point Objective (RPO), in accordance with standards such as ISO 22301. Assess
							and recommend appropriate DR solutions, such as Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS), to
							ensure fast and effective recovery after a disaster.</p>

						<li><strong>Critical analysis of emerging trends in security risk management</strong></li>
						<p>Identify and analyze future trends in SRM, such as critical system resilience, artificial
							intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT). Evaluate the impact of new technologies
							and the ethical challenges associated with their integration into critical infrastructures.
						</p>

						<li><strong>Resilience and proactive risk management</strong></li>
						<p>Develop resilience strategies to ensure service continuity in critical environments despite
							cyberattacks. Integrate AI-based proactive cybersecurity solutions to automate threat
							detection and response, while addressing ethical and regulatory aspects.</p>

						<li><strong>Ethical and regulatory approach to security risk management</strong></li>
						<p>Recognize the ethical, legal, and regulatory issues in using advanced technologies such as AI
							and IoT to ensure data protection and compliance. Integrate these considerations into risk
							management strategies to ensure security while respecting users' rights.</p>

							<p>This section contains my academic research, case studies, and projects related to
								security and risk management. It includes in-depth threat analyses, risk scenarios, and
								studies on real-world cybersecurity incidents. These artefacts demonstrate my ability to
								assess vulnerabilities, apply security frameworks, and propose strategies to strengthen
								the protection of critical infrastructures against emerging threats.</p>
