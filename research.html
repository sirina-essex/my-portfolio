								<h3>Artefacts</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This section contains my academic work, research artefacts, and applied projects related to
                                research methods and professional practice in computing. It includes literature reviews, research
                                proposals, data analysis exercises, and reflections on ethical and professional responsibilities.
                                These artefacts demonstrate my ability to apply rigorous research methodologies, critically evaluate
                                academic sources, and conduct investigations grounded in ethical, legal, and professional standards.

							<p>
								This section gathers the progression of what I have learned, unit by unit, in research methods 
                                and professional practice: the outcomes, the reflections, and how they have shaped my approach 
                                to academic investigation and ethical computing.
