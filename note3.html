						<h2>Feedback from Tutor: Karen Outram</h2>
						<blockquote>
							<p><strong>There are some good observations and discussions regarding ethics and issues surrounding ethics, here is some constructive feedback as follows for posts. Please note these comments are not engineered towards any one person, the comments are there to support everyone in their academic journey.</strong></p>
							<p>When listing long references simply do this in alphabetical order and don't add bullet points, numbers or hyphens at the side of each reference</p>
							<p>Remember all academic discussion is about debate, discussion and comparison, [this is the critical evaluative aspect of academic writing]. Don't just merely interpret research you read, as this lends itself to descriptive interpretation of content as opposed to academic debate based writing.</p>
							<p>Keep all discussion academically formal, and don't write using conversational tones</p>
							<p>When expressing opinion, ensure it is objective and underpinned by theoretical discussion that is valid and objective. This also gives opportunity to cite when expressing personal opinion, underpinned by theory</p>
							<p>Use full words and not contractions in academic writing and so I'm should be I am for example</p>
							<p>Use good-cross sectional research resources for formative and summative assignments. Using limited research resources restricts academic context, depth and breadth in academic content</p>
							<p>Cite in each paragraph; content and discussion is coming from somewhere and so please fully cite your research/facts</p>
							<p>Ensure that paragraphs are evenly weighted, with clear spacing between paragraphs and List of References. Double line spacing needs to be applied to content in paragraphs also, [part of standard academic conventions]</p>
							<p>Ensure long Harvard Referencing and citation are accurate. Have the University of Essex Harvard referencing document open at all times for reference</p>
							<p>Don't use bullet points in text; use full sentences and paragraphs to discuss, compare and analyse research</p>
							<p>When using speech marks this denotes a quote is occurring and so ensure that citation occurs after every quote. If you are not using a quotation then please don't use speech marks to highlight words.</p>

							<p> Thank you for the valuable insights. Your analysis effectively highlights Abi’s ethical obligations, emphasizing data integrity and the risks of selective reporting. Stressing that emphasizing only favorable analyses constitutes ethical manipulation is a strong point, promoting transparency and outcome consideration. Your call for Abi to disclose both positive and negative findings with methodological context is well-grounded and supports scientific integrity.</p>
							<p> However, the application of the Declaration of Helsinki is slightly overstated, as it primarily applies to medical research. A more relevant framework, like (‘Codex Alimentarius Commission Procedural Manual’, 2023) could better address food safety concerns for a consumer product like Whizzz. Additionally, while you suggest practical steps like including a disclaimer or negotiating publication terms, these could be expanded with guidance from professional codes, such as (Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice (2025) which emphasizes proactive communication to prevent misuse of findings. </p>
							<p> Your discussion of legal implications correctly notes potential breaches of consumer protection laws but could benefit from citing specific regulations, such as food labelling standards, to strengthen relevance. The mention of whistleblowing is apt, but further clarification on Abi’s legal safeguards would enhance the discussion. Socially, your point about eroding public trust is compelling, though further elaboration on the broader societal impact of research misconduct would strengthen the argument. For instance, emphasizing the potential harm to vulnerable populations, like children consuming Whizzz, could highlight the stakes involved.</p>
							<p> Overall, your response robustly addresses Abi’s ethical and professional responsibilities, with a clear focus on transparency. Refining the applicability of frameworks and expanding on practical and legal protections would enhance its depth.</p>

							<p>Stephanie's entry effectively outlines the dilemma faced by Abi, highlighting possible courses of action, the ethical and legal duties of a researcher, and the several breaches of conduct associated the manufacturer's actions, should it truly not be forthcoming with Whizzz's performance, ultimately stating that Abi won't be able to remain truly impartial in this situation.</p>
							<p>While neutrality, impartiality, and independence contribute to what defines research itself, researchers must, nonetheless, be prepared for situations where their impartiality and independence are distrusted for various reasons (Slotfeldt-Ellingsen, 2023). Therefore, and in the face of the manufacturer's actions, not only would Abi's neutrality be deeply distrusted by the general public, but, given his role as a project collaborator, his potential silence would also prove to be deeply unethical (Harlos, 2016). Furthermore, as outlined by my peer, the social and health implications of the manufacturer's actions are significant, as not disclosing potentially adverse health effects from Whizzz would violate the Codex Alimentarius (FAO/WHO, 2023) and many other food safety guidelines.</p>
							<p>In summary, Abi finds himself in a multifaceted situation where the usual neutrality found in research environments no longer applies, with Stephanie managing to provide sufficient context and supporting arguments to illustrate how unethical actions may produce significant aftershocks in industry, research, and even personal environments.</p>

							<p>Stephanie, your thorough analysis of Corazon’s Bluetooth-enabled cardiac implant indicates several significant shortcomings in striking the balance between patient safety and cybersecurity. Your discussion is highly relevant given the increasing integration between medical devices and digital health platforms (George & George, 2023). I especially liked the way you identified the hardcoded credential vulnerability, which corresponds to MITRE’s CWE-798 as a key vulnerability in the context of embedded systems (MITRE, 2024). This categorization explains the dangers to patient safety that Corazon’s inability to handle the issue exposes.
							</p>
							<p>Your application of the ACM Code of Ethics is particularly brilliant. Principle 1.2, which is aimed at the mitigation of harm, is seriously violated when Corazon prompts no form of patching, mitigation, or compensatory controls (ACM, 2018). This consideration brings to mind the claims of Nisha (2025), who advocates for the effectiveness of post-market cybersecurity management in securing patients. Additionally, the FDA (2023) and NIST (2020) emphasize the need for continuous risk management throughout the entire medical device lifecycle, which supports your argument.</p>
							<p>I also liked your focus on the ethical responsibility of transparency. By not disclosing the vulnerability, Corazon deprives the patients of making informed healthcare choices. This action violates the ACM Principle on honesty: Principle 1.3 and the BCS duty to ensure protection of public welfare (Javaid et al., 2023). This lack of transparency is symptomatic of a larger problem in healthcare, wherein technological flaws are often swept under the carpet instead of being disclosed responsibly.</p>
							<p>That recommendation for layered security measures and proactive post-market updates is strongly supported by others, who believe that, irrespective of the mitigations, partial ones are ethically preferable to ignoring known vulnerabilities. Your analysis successfully explains why companies such as Corazon have to follow a transparent and proactive approach with regard to managing cyber risks in medical technologies.</p>

							<p>Stephanie, your analysis of Corazon’s Bluetooth-enabled cardiac implant is precise and effective in structuring the ethical issues at the intersection of medical safety and cybersecurity. I was most convinced by your discussion concerning the hardcoded credential vulnerability, as it is a significant weakness that could be exploited and, as such, poses serious problems for patient safety, privacy, and data integrity (George & George, 2023).</p>
							<p>Your argumentation on the use of the ACM Code of Ethics is good. In particular, you effectively address the issue of not offering patching, mitigation, or compensatory controls for the vulnerability (Archer, 2024). Principle 1.2, which states the responsibility to avoid harm, is violated when Corazon does not offer controls for the vulnerability. According to George et al. (2021), post-market cybersecurity management is not merely an option, but an essential facet that should be practiced for the safety of patients, especially after the identification of flaws in the market. In strengthening your case, you consistently refer to the guidance from the FDA (2023), which highlights the significance of continuous risk management throughout the lifecycle of medical devices and updates after market release.</p>
							<p>Your emphasis on transparency is well-taken. Failure to share information about these risks deprives patients of making informed choices, violating ACM Principle 1.3 and the BCS Code of Conduct in terms of upholding the public interest (Tettey et al., 2024). Thomasian and Adashi (2021) also suggest layered protection and partial mitigations as a responsible step forward, which backs your call for protective measures, even if a complete solution is not immediately at hand.</p>
							Overall, your post demonstrates that medical device producers must prioritize making devices cybersecure and transparent throughout their entire production process. Your analysis provides fascinating insights into the use of responsible design, constant monitoring, and forthright communication in maintaining patient safety in connected healthcare settings.

							<p>Stephanie, you have effectively shown how important it is to balance medical urgency with responsible cybersecurity practice. Unauthorised reboots have the potential to destabilise pacing operations and increase hazards to patients’ cardiac well-being (Das et al., 2021). It is reasonable for medical teams to weigh risks, but NIST (2020) made a persuasive case that ignoring vulnerabilities without a proper response is not proportionate to clinical needs. The argument for sufficient information is substantial, yet the focus on empowering patients should be emphasised. Disclosing risks may not always ensure that patients understand and weigh their cybersecurity impact when making decisions (FDA, 2023). This prompts one to consider whether voluminous and technical disclosures about vulnerabilities meet the duty of honesty if patients cannot make sense of them.</p>
							<p> Returning to your earlier discussion, Corazon’s neglect to introduce security measures, such as hardware proxies, reinforces the importance of their duty to the public good. NIST SP 800-53 requires such compensatory measures, yet Corazon’s inability to act demonstrates a general lack of attention to post-market management (NIST, 2020). The FDA reinforced “secure-by-design” principles last year, yet Corazon’s approach contradicts them by developing irreparable implants.
							<p> However, this view overlooks that supplanting or replacing affected implants during surgery complicates any decision to retain unmitigated risks. Williams and Woodward (2015) argue that ethical risk governance necessitates active risk minimisation rather than allowing risks to persist. Lack of openness and appropriate planning around mitigating vulnerability is responsible for the main ethical violation (FDA, 2023). Your analysis emphasises the importance of developing regulatory mechanisms that ensure security lifecycle management in medical devices, as cybersecurity is critical for patient safety.</p>
