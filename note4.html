						<h1>My Contributions to Teamwork</h1>
					</header>
					<p>My key contribution was during the group assignment preparation. In the group activity, I created
						a business process diagram, but my primary role in the team was
						Analyst for Digitization Risks. I was responsible for assessing the risks associated with the
						digitization of Pampered Pets and developing the attack tree. Additionally, I took minutes of
						meeting (MoM) during one of our meetings</p>

									<h2>Assessment of Risks for the Digitization of Pampered Pets </h2>
								</header>
								<p>The digitization of Pampered Pets exposes the company to a wide array of risks. Using
									threat modeling techniques such as STRIDE, OCTAVE, Attack Trees, and CVSS, the
									analysis identifies and prioritizes threats by considering cybersecurity,
									regulatory, operational, reputational, and strategic risks.</p>

								<h2>Types of Risks Considered</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Cybersecurity Risks:</strong> These threats compromise digital systems,
										including hacking, ransomware, and security breaches (Gupta, Agrawal, and
										Yamaguchi, 2020).</li>
									<li><strong>Regulatory Risks:</strong> Non-compliance with regulations like GDPR,
										which could result in financial penalties and harm to reputation (Kuner,
										Bygrave, and Docksey, 2020).</li>
									<li><strong>Operational Risks:</strong> These threats impact the continuity of
										operations, such as service disruptions and supply chain issues (Shostack,
										2014).</li>
									<li><strong>Reputational Risks:</strong> Impact on customer perception, primarily
										due to data breaches or service interruptions (Drennan and Goudge, 2019).</li>
									<li><strong>Strategic Risks:</strong> Threats that affect the company's ability to
										digitally evolve and meet customer demands (Anderson, 2020).</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Mapping and Prioritization of Potential Threats</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/figure4.PNG" alt=""
										style="width:65%;" /></span>

								<h2>Explanation of Prioritization</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Very High:</strong> Critical threats to customer data and compliance
										(e.g., GDPR), with a strong impact on reputation and significant financial
										penalties (Kuner, Bygrave, and Docksey, 2020).</li>
									<li><strong>High:</strong> Threats disrupting operational continuity (e.g.,
										ransomware, DoS), leading to service interruptions and financial losses (Gupta,
										Agrawal, and Yamaguchi, 2020).</li>
									<li><strong>Medium:</strong> Internal threats to systems (APIs, payments), moderate
										but requiring targeted security measures (Shostack, 2014).</li>
									<li><strong>Low:</strong> Less likely threats (phishing, BYOD), manageable with
										solid security policies, limited impact (Anderson, 2020).</li>
								</ul>
