						<h2>Summary Post</h2>
						<blockquote>

							<p>I presented the ethical issues raised by the Bluetooth-enabled cardiac implant developed by Corazon, which contains a critical vulnerability: a hardcoded identifier allowing remote reboot, acknowledged but left unpatched. This decision was justified by the medical risks of surgical intervention, yet it raises major concerns in terms of security, transparency, and responsibility. </p>
							<p>It was asserted that Corazon’s inaction constitutes a clear violation of cybersecurity principles and professional codes of ethics (ACM, BCS). The absence of compensatory measures (security proxy, active logging, application-level filtering), combined with a lack of patient information, compromises both the integrity of clinical data and the right to informed consent. According to Freyer et al. (2024), excluding cybersecurity from benefit-risk assessments in medical devices is incompatible with responsible healthcare ethics. Furthermore, Das et al. (2021) emphasise that securing implant software should be treated as no less a priority than post-operative clinical monitoring. </p>
							<p>An analysis of ACM principles 1.2, 1.3, 2.5, and 2.9, alongside the four core duties of the BCS Code of Conduct, reveals severe ethical shortcomings in the company’s governance. The contrast between Corazon’s declared compliance (certifications, disclosure programmes) and the absence of actual remediation only reinforces this criticism.</p>
							<p>My peers’ contributions helped confirm and deepen these conclusions. Rodrigo Pereira Cruz, Ali Alzahmi, Fahad Abdallah, and Nasser Al-Naimi each underscored that the absence of corrective action, even partial, in the face of a known vulnerability, constitutes a clear ethical breach (Nisha, 2025; FDA, 2023; NIST, 2020; Thomasian & Adashi, 2021).</p>
							<p>Pëllumb Dalipi highlighted that for non-modifiable devices, risk governance must be anticipated from the design phase, incorporating threat modelling and layered safeguards (Pycroft & Aziz, 2018). He also noted that a lack of transparency can erode clinical trust, as the failure to clearly communicate known flaws undermines the relationship between manufacturers, patients, and healthcare professionals (Freyer et al., 2024).</p>
							<p>Ali Alzahmi introduced the concept of cybersecurity medicine (George & George, 2023), arguing that cybersecurity in medical devices must be seen as an integral clinical responsibility.</p>
							<p>Fahad Abdallah expanded on this by underlining the role of responsible design throughout the entire device lifecycle, and the need for transparency to be active, continuous, and embedded in production and monitoring processes.</p>
							<p>Finally, Nasser Al-Naimi pointed out that risk disclosure is only ethical if it is understandable. Overly technical information can render informed consent ineffective, despite its formal presence (FDA, 2023; Williams & Woodward, 2015).</p>
							<p>This case illustrates the fragility of connected healthcare systems when security is deprioritised. It highlights the need to embed cybersecurity requirements at the design stage, especially for non-modifiable devices, to ensure continuous patient protection and uphold professional credibility.</p>
