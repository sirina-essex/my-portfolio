							<p>Stephanie's entry presents a comprehensive overview of the potential dangers associated with the integration of cutting-edge technology in medical implants. The use of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct's medical implants scenario by my peer illustrates how unethical and vulnerable medical implant-attached critical systems can not only breach several codes of conduct, but pose existential risk.</p>
							<p>Medical implant vulnerability has become a rising concern, with potential malicious applications including attackers exerting control over implants (Pycroft et al., 2016) and even turning off implants completely (Camara et al., 2015). Such attacks would have catastrophic consequences for critical systems, with realistic outcomes ranging from severe patient impairment to even death. Fortunately, significant efforts have been directed into improving medical implant security, especially those that rely on internet access (Catuogno and Galdi, 2024).</p>
							<p>Overall, medical implant security is of paramount concern. As Stephanie posits, critical systems must be reliable and have solid mitigation strategies even if the solution is not yet fully developed. As such devices become increasingly advanced and used to treat increasingly diverse medical conditions, ranging from those in the brain to those in the heart, their underlying technology must, too, evolve alongside them.</p>

							<p>My peer Stephanie raises the critical concerns about the ethical vulnerabilities in Corazon’s approach, and I’d like to build on this by focusing on the systemic implications of allowing uncorrectable vulnerabilities in critical medical infrastructure. When design decisions lead to unpatchable systems, the burden shifts toward anticipatory governance by designing with possible failure in mind. As argued by Pycroft and Aziz (2018), this necessitates a far more rigorous pre-deployment security strategy, including threat modeling and layered safeguards, especially for devices interfacing with wireless protocols in clinical environments such as hospitals.</p>
							<p>Another point that is of importance but is often underrepresented in in these conversations is the long-term erosion of clinical trust when manufacturers withhold vulnerability details. This lack of transparency can undermine informed consent and also degrade institutional accountability. As Freyer et al. (2024) note, risk-benefit analysis must explicitly integrate cybersecurity exposure, especially when failure modes disrupt monitoring or alter clinical outcomes. Patients and clinicians alike should be aware of risks as uncertainty without transparency can cause unexpected effects.</p>
							<p>Finally, Corazon’s inaction illustrates a broader ethical deficit in post-market surveillance. As Camara et al. (2015) emphasize, once devices are implanted, continuous monitoring for threats must be a central part of the clinical lifecycle, not an afterthought. Certification should not be viewed as an endpoint but a starting point to ensure that adaptive oversight is possible. Otherwise, these innovative technologies could be considered a liability rather than a benefit.</p>

						<blockquote>

							<p>Stephanie, your thorough analysis of Corazon’s Bluetooth-enabled cardiac implant indicates several significant shortcomings in striking the balance between patient safety and cybersecurity. Your discussion is highly relevant given the increasing integration between medical devices and digital health platforms (George & George, 2023). I especially liked the way you identified the hardcoded credential vulnerability, which corresponds to MITRE’s CWE-798 as a key vulnerability in the context of embedded systems (MITRE, 2024). This categorization explains the dangers to patient safety that Corazon’s inability to handle the issue exposes.
							</p>
							<p>Your application of the ACM Code of Ethics is particularly brilliant. Principle 1.2, which is aimed at the mitigation of harm, is seriously violated when Corazon prompts no form of patching, mitigation, or compensatory controls (ACM, 2018). This consideration brings to mind the claims of Nisha (2025), who advocates for the effectiveness of post-market cybersecurity management in securing patients. Additionally, the FDA (2023) and NIST (2020) emphasize the need for continuous risk management throughout the entire medical device lifecycle, which supports your argument.</p>
							<p>I also liked your focus on the ethical responsibility of transparency. By not disclosing the vulnerability, Corazon deprives the patients of making informed healthcare choices. This action violates the ACM Principle on honesty: Principle 1.3 and the BCS duty to ensure protection of public welfare (Javaid et al., 2023). This lack of transparency is symptomatic of a larger problem in healthcare, wherein technological flaws are often swept under the carpet instead of being disclosed responsibly.</p>
							<p>That recommendation for layered security measures and proactive post-market updates is strongly supported by others, who believe that, irrespective of the mitigations, partial ones are ethically preferable to ignoring known vulnerabilities. Your analysis successfully explains why companies such as Corazon have to follow a transparent and proactive approach with regard to managing cyber risks in medical technologies.</p>

							<p>Stephanie, your analysis of Corazon’s Bluetooth-enabled cardiac implant is precise and effective in structuring the ethical issues at the intersection of medical safety and cybersecurity. I was most convinced by your discussion concerning the hardcoded credential vulnerability, as it is a significant weakness that could be exploited and, as such, poses serious problems for patient safety, privacy, and data integrity (George & George, 2023).</p>
							<p>Your argumentation on the use of the ACM Code of Ethics is good. In particular, you effectively address the issue of not offering patching, mitigation, or compensatory controls for the vulnerability (Archer, 2024). Principle 1.2, which states the responsibility to avoid harm, is violated when Corazon does not offer controls for the vulnerability. According to George et al. (2021), post-market cybersecurity management is not merely an option, but an essential facet that should be practiced for the safety of patients, especially after the identification of flaws in the market. In strengthening your case, you consistently refer to the guidance from the FDA (2023), which highlights the significance of continuous risk management throughout the lifecycle of medical devices and updates after market release.</p>
							<p>Your emphasis on transparency is well-taken. Failure to share information about these risks deprives patients of making informed choices, violating ACM Principle 1.3 and the BCS Code of Conduct in terms of upholding the public interest (Tettey et al., 2024). Thomasian and Adashi (2021) also suggest layered protection and partial mitigations as a responsible step forward, which backs your call for protective measures, even if a complete solution is not immediately at hand.</p>
							Overall, your post demonstrates that medical device producers must prioritize making devices cybersecure and transparent throughout their entire production process. Your analysis provides fascinating insights into the use of responsible design, constant monitoring, and forthright communication in maintaining patient safety in connected healthcare settings.

							<p>Stephanie, you have effectively shown how important it is to balance medical urgency with responsible cybersecurity practice. Unauthorised reboots have the potential to destabilise pacing operations and increase hazards to patients’ cardiac well-being (Das et al., 2021). It is reasonable for medical teams to weigh risks, but NIST (2020) made a persuasive case that ignoring vulnerabilities without a proper response is not proportionate to clinical needs. The argument for sufficient information is substantial, yet the focus on empowering patients should be emphasised. Disclosing risks may not always ensure that patients understand and weigh their cybersecurity impact when making decisions (FDA, 2023). This prompts one to consider whether voluminous and technical disclosures about vulnerabilities meet the duty of honesty if patients cannot make sense of them.</p>
							<p> Returning to your earlier discussion, Corazon’s neglect to introduce security measures, such as hardware proxies, reinforces the importance of their duty to the public good. NIST SP 800-53 requires such compensatory measures, yet Corazon’s inability to act demonstrates a general lack of attention to post-market management (NIST, 2020). The FDA reinforced “secure-by-design” principles last year, yet Corazon’s approach contradicts them by developing irreparable implants.
							<p> However, this view overlooks that supplanting or replacing affected implants during surgery complicates any decision to retain unmitigated risks. Williams and Woodward (2015) argue that ethical risk governance necessitates active risk minimisation rather than allowing risks to persist. Lack of openness and appropriate planning around mitigating vulnerability is responsible for the main ethical violation (FDA, 2023). Your analysis emphasises the importance of developing regulatory mechanisms that ensure security lifecycle management in medical devices, as cybersecurity is critical for patient safety.</p>
