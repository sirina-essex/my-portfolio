								<h2>Contribution to Pëllumb Dalipi's Post on Dark UX patterns</h2>
								<p><strong>Peer response by Stephanie Irina - Tuesday, 6 May 2025, 10:55 PM</strong>
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>Thank you for your insightful analysis. I completely agree with the ethical breaches related to dark UX patterns, as well as the tension between short-term business goals and long-term professional responsibility. It is also important to emphasise the responsibility of the developer, whose position raises an essential ethical concern: what level of responsibility does a professional have when they are aware of potential harm, yet decide to proceed?</p>
									<p>The ACM Code of Ethics provides clear guidance on this matter. Principle 1.3 highlights the duty to act with honesty and transparency, including the obligation to report any known limitations or risks of a system. Principle 3.1 states that professionals must raise concerns about potential harm, and escalate them if no action is taken by management. Principle 3.4 also underlines the need to document concerns and support the development of internal policies that promote ethical practice. In this context, not producing a report, not proposing a UX review, or not keeping a written record of objections can be seen as passive complicity. This is consistent with the work of Aydemir and Dalpiaz (2018), who outline a structured approach to integrating ethics into software engineering, and stress the developer’s active role in identifying, documenting, and reporting unethical behaviour.</p>
									<p>The BCS Code of Conduct reinforces this responsibility, particularly through duties 2.f and 3.a to 3.e, which link ethical awareness, shared responsibility, and legal considerations such as consumer protection and accessibility. Simply following instructions does not relieve a developer from their moral responsibility in contributing to a deceptive or harmful system. Gray et al. (2018) clearly describe this dilemma in the context of UX design, pointing out the importance of raising concerns and keeping formal records, even when not in a decision-making position.</p>

								<h2>Contribution to Rodrigo Pereira Cruz's Post: Death Machines - The Ethics of Autonomous Weapons</h2>
								<p><strong>Peer response by Stephanie Irina - Friday, 2 May 2025, 7:36 PM</strong>
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>The issue of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) indeed raises numerous ethical and political challenges. Beyond the legitimate criticism of observed abuses, it is also useful to consider that certain tightly regulated uses of these technologies could help reduce human casualties, for example by lowering the exposure of soldiers or by integrating automatic deactivation mechanisms in the presence of civilians. This suggests that the real problem often lies less in the technology itself than in the lack of clear governance, decision-making transparency, and shared accountability mechanisms.</p>
									<p>Another major concern is the risk of dehumanising decision-making. Delegating lethal decision-making power to an algorithm raises a fundamental question: who is responsible in the event of an error or misuse? This dilution of moral and legal judgement can lead to a form of systemic irresponsibility, as thoroughly examined by Malik (2017). In response to this issue, Verdiesen, Santoni de Sio, and Dignum (2021) propose a governance framework based on distributed human responsibility, which clearly assigns roles throughout the system’s lifecycle—from design to operational deployment. This approach encourages ethical oversight and helps reduce decision-making grey areas.</p>
									<p>Similarly, Amoroso and Tamburrini (2021) provide a legal and ethical definition of what constitutes “meaningful human control” in a framework aligned with international humanitarian law. According to them, such control not only requires human presence in the decision-making loop, but also a real ability to understand, anticipate, and interrupt system behaviour, even in complex operational environments. This reinforces the idea that autonomy must never become a way to escape responsibility, and that human supervision remains essential to ensure the ethical and legal compliance of lethal decisions.</p>
